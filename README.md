### What kind of content?

Submit any reasons you love Saint John: cool places to eat, drink, or visit, fun facts about the city, or anything else you think would be interesting. Our main purpose is to share with the world the many reasons we think SJ is a great place to live, work, and visit and content will be incorporated as it aligns with this goal.

Hello Saint John will not feature advertisements, political support, or discriminatory content. 

## Editing Content

Most site content is written in Pug templates which produce the site HTML.

The Pug files are located in `/src/templates`.

Note that these aren't markdown files and the syntax and whitespace you use does matter quite a bit. See the [Pug documentation](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) to see how to use Pug.

## Editing CSS

This site uses [Stylus for preprocessing](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). Please follow the established indentation and commenting patterns.

Stylus files are located in `/src/styl`.
